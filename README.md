# Full Name Sorting

The Goal: Name Sorter
Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have.
A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.

**Example Usage**

Given a file unsorted-names-list.txt containing the following list of names:
>Janet Parsons
>Vaugh Lewis
>Adonis Julius Archer
>Shelby Nathan Yoder
>Marin Alvarez
>London Lindsey
>Beau Tristan Bentley
>Leo Gardner
>Hunter Uriah Mathew Clarke
>Mikayla Lopez
>Frankie Conner Ritter

Executing the program in the following way:
_name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt_

Should result the sorted names to screen:

>Marin Alvarez
>Adonis Julius Archer
>Beau Tristan Bentley
>Hunter Uriah Mathew Clarke
>Leo Gardner
>Vaughn Lewis
>London Lindsey
>Mikayla Lopez
>Janet Parsons
>Frankie Conner Ritter
>Shelby Nathan Yoder

The program should also write the sorted names to a file called sorted-names-list.txt.
